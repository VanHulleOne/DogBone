Figura takes all of the parameters and the input shape and creates each layer
for every part. These layers are then converted to Gcode in the form of a list
of strings. The list is stored in self.gcode which can then be accessed and written
to the correct output file by using join().

A layer in Figura starts as a list of LineGroups, typically shells in (Shapes)
and then an InFill but could also be a variety of different shapes all printed
at the same Z-height. The list of layers is then organized and turned into a single
LineGroup with the order of the lines being the print order of the layer. The
goal is to allow easy adjustability when deciding how to organize a layer.
Different organizedLayer() methods could be written calling different
organizing coroutines in the LineGroups to create an ideal print order.

The longest computation time is in creating the infill for the layers. As such
the parameters which make a layer unique are used as a key for the self.layers{}
dictionary. After the layer has been calculated it is stored in layers so that
if another layer with the same parameters is used it does not need to be recalculated.
I will not list the key parameters here since they are still fluid and I am trying
to avoid having inaccurate comments.
